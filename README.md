## :ship: :bomb:**INTRODUCTION**
In this course, I created a multi-player online version of a Salvo-like game engine. Salvo was a pencil and paper game that was the basis for the popular Battleship game. The basic idea involves guessing where other players have hidden objects.
My job was create a back-end game server to manage the games, scoring, and player profiles. I used the Spring Boot framework for the Java-based RESTful web server.

I learned how to develop a web application using Java RESTful web service to handle multi-user access and communication, store persistent data and implement complex business logic. More specifically, I have learned to:

 - Use Java and the Spring Boot suite of tools to:
   - implement a RESTful API to both the database and application services
   - apply modern-day Java programming concepts, such as lambdas, streams, and dependency injection
 - Use JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) data structures to:
   - communicate between application's JavaScript front-end and Java back-end
   - implement the "model" in a model-view-controller
